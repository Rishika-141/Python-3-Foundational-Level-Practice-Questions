Python Foundations – Practice Questions

This repository contains Python foundational practice questions, including IIT Madras BS foundational level questions, focused on building core programming logic and understanding basic Python concepts through hands-on coding.

For each program, the problem statement is written as a comment before the code, followed by its implementation.
