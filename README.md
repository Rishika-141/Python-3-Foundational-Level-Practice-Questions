📘 PYTHON FOUNDATIONS – PRACTICE QUESTIONS

A structured, hands-on learning journey through core Python concepts.

Inspired by foundational practice material from the
IIT Madras BS Program, this repository showcases my week-by-week progress as I build programming fundamentals with clarity and consistency.

Each problem includes a commented description followed by a clean, beginner-friendly Python solution.

🔹 WEEK 1 — THE BASICS
Week 1 – Python Syntax, I/O & Simple Operations

Foundational introductions to:

- Core Python syntax
- Input & output (input(), print())
- Arithmetic operations
- Strings and basic string handling

🔹 WEEK 2 — DECISION MAKING
Week 2 – Conditionals

Logic-building through branching:

- if, elif, else
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Real-world decision-making problems

🔹 WEEK 3 — LOOPS & ITERATION
Week 3 – Iteration

Repetition and control flow structures:

- for loops
- while loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Basic patterns and iteration-based exercises

🔹 WEEK 4 — LISTS & DATA SEQUENCING
Week 4 – Lists Only

A dedicated week of list-focused problems:

- List creation and updates
- Indexing, slicing, nested lists
- Common methods (append, sort, etc.)
- Iterating over lists
- Exercises centered solely on list logic (Matrices Problems)

🔹 WEEK 5 — FUNCTIONS & MODULAR THINKING
Week 5 – Functions & Calling Functions

Modular, reusable programming design:

- Defining functions with def
- Building multiple separate functions
- Parameters & return values
- Calling functions cleanly
- Structuring solutions using modular logic
  (No nested functions — focus on clarity.)

📝 CODE STRUCTURE

Each file includes:

- Multiple weekly practice questions
- Problem statements as comments
- Clean, readable implementations
- Gradual progression of logic and difficulty

🎯 PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY

This project helps reinforce:

- Python fundamentals
- Logical & algorithmic thinking
- Clean, modular coding habits
- A consistent track of learning progress
- Preparation for interviews & real-world coding tasks
- How to solve mini games like "Random Guessing Number" using Python

🔄 ONGOING UPDATES

I will continue updating this repository as I learn more — adding new weeks, refining code, and expanding the practice set.
